## Printing a Rover Chassis in a 3D printer
Our project consists of printing a Rover Chassis using a 3D printer. This inform includes:

```markdown
1. The steps of installation.
2. Usage.
3. Maintenance for a proper operation.
4. Recommendations that are necessary when printing.
5. The solutions for the most common problems.
6. Images of our Chassis with all the pieces printed in plastic.
```
## Material and equipment

For our projects we are using the following materials:
1. Printer 3D ZORTRAX M200
2. Raspberry Pi 3 1GB RAM 32GB SD CARD
3. SD card to store the models to be printed.
4. Filament ABS
5. Laptop    
6. Model Refinement;
   6.1 Cuter
   6.2 Sculptor knife
   6.3 Cutting pliers
   6.4 Spatula
   6.5 Gloves
   
## Programming environment
Once you have the model in *.stl format you must go through a preprocessing before being printed, this is done with the zortrax, Z-suite brand software.

## Estimated Time

- **September 03:**  Project definition 
- **September 06:**  Analysis of the tools to use.
- **September 10:**  Tests for the printing of the pieces.
- **September 11:**  September 13   & Impression of the pieces.
- **September 16:**  October 04  & Impression of the pieces II.

## Restrictions

- The model to be printed must not exceed the size of the platform.
- While printing process, a person must be present to solve unforeseen events.
- The printing plate must be clean.
- The printer system must be updated.
- The head must be calibrated before each print.

## Posible Structure

We are using a 3D model made in SketchUp, from (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2527319)


## Instructions

1. Printing of out Model
2. Cleaning the platform after each impression
3. Calibration
4. Change the filament
5. Keep the printer stable
6. Keep the room well ventilated
